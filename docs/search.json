    "text": "I decided to dive into researching the job prospects of fresh graduates from Singaporean universities for a few reasons. As a third-year student myself, the looming specter of post-grad life is getting real, and this research is not only interesting but also helps me wrap my head around what’s waiting for me after graduation. There’s also this perpetual stereotype in Singapore that an individual will be more successful if he/she comes from a certain university or takes certain courses (FASS graduates aren’t paid well..?). With the changing job scene in Singapore and the ever-rising cost of living — not to forget the COVID-19 economic downturn — employability is a concern that plagues many soon-to-be-graduates and fresh graduates.\nThe dataset that I have chosen depicts a Graduate Employment Survey carried out among fresh graduates of local universities from 2013 to 2021. The dataset can be found here: https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/415/view. It consists of data from\n\nNanyang Technological University (NTU)\nNational University of Singapore (NUS)\nSingapore Institute of Technology (SIT)\nSingapore Management University (SMU)\nSingapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS)\nSingapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)\n\nI first began by finding the total mean employment rate by year, by combining all of the individual employment rates across the universities each year.\n \nIt can be observed that there has been an overall increase in the employment rate over the years. This is notable despite the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. Perhaps this can be attributed to industry trends, where several sectors experiencing growth in Singapore — such as finance, AI, and the green economy — place value on the skills possessed by fresh graduates.\nSo, that’s the first issue out of the way. Is it getting increasingly more difficult for fresh graduates to be employed? The short answer is no. Now let’s take a look at how this mean employment rate varies for fresh graduates from different universities.\n \nWe see that the average employment rate in 2021 — the most recent year in the dataset — is highest for SMU."
