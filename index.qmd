title: "Employability of Fresh Graduates from Universities in Singapore"
---

Hi, my name is Qistina and I am majoring in Geography. I am taking NM2207 this semester as part of my Communications and New Media minor.

The dataset that I have chosen depicts a Graduate Employment Survey carried out among fresh graduates of local universities from 2013 to 2021. The dataset can be found here: <https://beta.data.gov.sg/collections/415/view>

I decided to dive into researching the job prospects of fresh graduates from Singaporean universities for a few reasons. As a third-year student myself, the looming specter of post-grad life is getting real, and this research is not only interesting but also helps me wrap my head around what's waiting for me after graduation. There's also this perpetual stereotype in Singapore that an individual will be more successful if he/she comes from a certain university or takes certain courses (FASS graduates aren't paid well..?). With the changing job scene in Singapore and the ever-rising cost of living — not to forget the COVID-19 economic downturn — employability is a concern that plagues many soon-to-be-graduates and fresh graduates.
